Some Caveats:
- This is not my final result
   - Using my test_scrape file, I am working on implementing my results over multiple seasons. At first, I thought expanding this across different years would be much easier than it actually is. I have to take into account what year the game was played in to determine what stadium the game was played at. This is basically the root of a problem that has taken me many hours to iron out, and I have yet to solve it completely. My main_program fulfills, in my eyes, the requirements of the project.
- Data is not precise.
   - Due to the availability of free weather data, I was only able to determine the maximum temperature and total precipitation for the day of the game in question. With access to a better, paid, weather API, I would be able to compare across different weather types and get more minute measurements of weather.
